The Agile Track System is a web-based Single Page Application built using React.js for the frontend and Spring Boot (Java) for the backend. It allows users to log in, view tasks, update progress, and collaborate in scrum teams. Admins have the ability to manage users, scrum teams, and tasks dynamically through a centralÂ dashboard.
